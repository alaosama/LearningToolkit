// Example: Instructions: Write an algorithm in JavaScript that takes a positive integer n as input and returns the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n. 
// If n is itself even, include it in the sum as well.
// For n = 6, the sum of even numbers from 1 to 6 is 2 + 4 + 6 = 12. For n = 7, the sum of even numbers from 1 to 7 is 2 + 4 + 6 = 12. For n = 8, 
// the sum of even numbers from 1 to 8 is 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20.
